The result of this website is my exam answer in the course HTML & CSS at Gokstad Akademiet. Sildajazzen is a real annual festival in Haugesund. However, I have chosen to exercise creative freedom, and all content on this page is fictional. Its sole purpose is for schoolwork and studies. 

## Description

Sildajazzen is a culture festival in Haugesund, hosting different concerts, activities, art exhibitions, theatre plays, and more! 
The focus on this exam is to make the site responsive by using grid and flexbox, inclusivity by writing neat code following good semantics and DRY principle, as well as including aria labels where it's needed.
